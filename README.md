# responsive-navbar
Responsive nav-bar with HTML, CSS and JS, included clip-path and animation.

But later in this projet i have achived the same functionality with only HTML and CSS.

I have followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4MkGzoACpQ), but later i applied some other technique to remove the JS code
